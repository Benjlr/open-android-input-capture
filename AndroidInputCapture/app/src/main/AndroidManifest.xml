        This is the AndroidManifest.xml for the Android *Library* module.
        It should NOT define the launcher activity for the application.
        That is the responsibility of the main app module (Unity's generated one).
        We only declare necessary permissions and potentially library-specific components
        if needed (though the helper approach doesn't require a dedicated activity).

    <application>
        <!-- No activity declaration here for the helper class -->
    </application>
    <!-- Add any required permissions here if your library needs them -->
    <!-- <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" /> -->
</manifest>
